testing for optimisation get interpretation as all true, but did not implment this
(this function always returns a true)
the point is not to test for tautology so shouldnt have a result that returns so

def checkString(s : String) : Boolean = {
    var s_temp = s
    while (s_temp.trim().nonEmpty){
      s_temp = s_temp.dropRight(1)
    }
    s_temp.trim().isEmpty
  }
