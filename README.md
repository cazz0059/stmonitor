# lchannels
Type-safe session programming in Scala

For more information and documentation, please refer to:
http://alcestes.github.io/lchannels/

**NOTE**: the current HEAD of the `lchannels` git repository requires
Scala 2.12.2 and Akka 2.5.0.
The [building instructions](http://alcestes.github.io/lchannels/instructions.html) are still valid, albeit they mention older versions of Scala and Akka.
