# Session Types Monitor
**Hybrid verification methodology for communication protocols in Scala built around the library [lchannels](https://github.com/alcestes/lchannels).**

A tool ([Synth](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/monitor/src/main/scala/monitor/Synth.scala)) that, given a session type _S_, can synthesise the Scala code of a type-checked monitor that verifies at runtime whether an interaction abides by _S_, and signatures usable to implement a process that interacts according to _S_. The generated monitors are embedded with runtime data checks as specified in the session types. More information can be found [here]().

To synthesise the monitors use [Synth](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/monitor/src/main/scala/monitor/Synth.scala) and pass the following as arguments: the **path** in which the file util.scala is found and where the monitor.scala and protocol.scala shall be generated, the **file name** containing the session type, and **what to synthesise** (i.e. the monitor or the classes only or both). The file util.scala might contain any functions used in the session types as assertions. If no assertions are present in the session type, the empty util.scala file should still be in the directory. Otherwise, before generating the monitor ensure to remove the `package` declaration. Once generated, the declaration should be placed again. Similarly, the declaration should also be placed in the generated monitors. 

_Examples_:

The monitors for the below examples are already generated and found in their respective directory. 

1. [game](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/monitor/examples/game): A client that interacts with a [server](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/scripts/game-server.py) through a TCP/IP socket to guess a number generated by the server itself. To run this example, first open another terminal and start the server using `python game-server.py `. Then start the client together with the monitor using [Demo](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/monitor/examples/game/Demo.scala).

2. [login](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/monitor/examples/login): A server that accepts connections from a TCP/IP socket for authenticating users. To run this example, first start the server together with the monitor using [Demo](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/monitor/examples/login/Demo.scala). Then start the [client](https://github.com/chrisbartoloburlo/stmonitor/blob/master/scripts/login-client.py) in a separate terminal using `python login-client.py`.
